# Mathified Frontend

This stores the code for Mathified's frontend. It's primarily written employing Next.js, a SSR framework based on React. The corresponding backend code for the site can be found in the repo "mathified-backend."

Mathified is a site which connects exprienced mathematicians to students who need help with math related concepts. This product arose after I had many conceptual questions which weren't easily satisfied: I had to post on various forums, only to recieve one clear answer, if lucky. This site has a select network of tutors dedicated to answering the problems users may post.
